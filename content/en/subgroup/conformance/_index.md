## Prpose

The OpenChain Project provides an [online self-authentication](https://certification.openchainproject.org/) that allows companies to self-verify whether they meet the OpenChain Specification.

With self-certification, companies can determine what is missing and what additional activities are required. If a company with a well-established open source compliance system can answer Yes to all inquries in the OpenChain's self-certification questionnaire, this can be submitted on the website (Conforming Submission). This will allow you to be recognized as an OpenChain Conformant company, as well as add your company's logo to the list of companies with OpenChain compliance programs on the website of the OpenChain project.

The Conformance Group is to study and share the best practices and activities that companies must undertake to build these OpenChain Conformant programs.

If you are an open source person in charge of a company looking to build an OpenChain Conformant program, please contact Conformance Group!
