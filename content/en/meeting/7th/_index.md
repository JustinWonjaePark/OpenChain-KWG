#### Main features

* Project : Perform the OSC process by creating it for each software you distribute

	* When the included OSS list is uploaded, the reviewer reviews, and the system shows the part that needs disclosure.(The details for each license are shown, so that the user can check the scope of source code disclosure)
	* Finally the OSS Notice is issued, and the file and source code to be disclosed are distributed to  [http://opensource.lge.com](http://opensource.lge.com)

* 3rd Party Project : Manage OSS list by 3rd party software

* OSS / License details : Obligation according to OSS, License, and Restriction can be checked. (Each nickname is managed and mapped even if the same license are indicated differently)

* Vulnerability : Check security vulnerabilities by OSS

* BAT (Binary analysis tool) : When a binary is uploaded, OSS is detected and displayed

#### Future plan

OSC System will be open sourced soon!
