## Case Study
* Are Fonts included in open source compliance activities? (Open Font)
* Does the company distribute mobile apps (Android, iOS) for in-house employees? So, is this in-house app also the target of open source compliance activities?
* What is the target of the open source security vulnerability inspection? Isn't it necessary to check not only the software you distribute, but also the software you are using for infrastructure and servers?
