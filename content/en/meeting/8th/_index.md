## Case Study
* Subject: What is the subject of open source compliance and security vulnerability checks?
  - Do you perform open source compliance activities for fonts? (Example: Open Font)
  - Does the company distribute mobile apps (Android, iOS) for in-house employees? If so, are you also performing open source compliance activities for them?
  - How do you classify the open source security vulnerability check targets? Do you include not only the software to be distributed, but also the software that is being used for infrastructure and servers as inspection targets?
